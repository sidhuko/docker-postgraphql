# Docker PostgraphQL  
This project aims to support releases of PostgraphQL as a service within docker.

It is currently in alpha, not secure or stable for production, to allow for discussion on techniques and performance based on previously discussed [issues](https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql/issues/84#issuecomment-243053660).
